% Step 1: Organize Your Data
% Your data should be organized in a matrix format where each 
% row represents a different time point and each column represents a different neuron.
% For instance, if you have recorded 100 neurons over 1000 time points, your data matrix 
% should be 1000 rows by 100 neurons.

% Step 2: Preprocess the Data
% Center the Data: PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data, so it%s important to center the data by subtracting the mean of each neuron's activity.

%data = [your_data_matrix]; % Replace with your data matrix
%data_centered = data - mean(data);

% Step 3: Perform PCA 
%[coeff, score, latent, tsquared, explained, mu] = pca(data_centered);

% coeff: Principal component coefficients, indicating the direction of each principal component in the original data space.
% score: Principal component scores, representing your original data in the new PCA space.
% latent: Eigenvalues, indicating the amount of variance captured by each principal component.
% tsquared: Hotelling's T-squared statistic for each observation.
% explained: The percentage of total variance explained by each principal component.
% mu: Estimated means of the input data.
