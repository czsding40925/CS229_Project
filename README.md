# CS229_Project 
We have the following folders 
* Documents: Project Proposal and such for reference
* Code: Contains all data and all MATLAB scripts for processing data & models. The three sets of main scripts are 
    * Alignment: Converting raw data to data aligned to each cue so they are organized for machine learning
    * All_Models_09_12/14/15: Three sets of files that contain the models that we run for each dataset. The models are LR, DT w/ Adaboost, GDA, NN, and PCA
    * Further_Processing: For plotting bar charts to compare accuracies/F1 scores and to plot confusion matrices. 
    * In addition, there are less relevant files
        * some helper functions (PlotConfusionMat, and lots of others in Util)
    * For data, the raw data are contained in the Data folder. While the data generated after running ML models are called data_summary_09_12/14/15 accordingly. In addition, CF_(Dates) are for plotting Confusion matrices. 
* Scratch Plots: Some plots we made along the way. Some of them ended up in our poster/final report, some were just for the purpose of fooling around or visualization. 
* Venv: Some Python files that are no longer relevant. Everything is done in MATLAB.
